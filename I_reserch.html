<h2>Malfunction Detection</h2>
<p><img src=images/Malfunction.png style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width:500px"></p><br />
  Issues of system protection and safety from system malfunction by software errors are increasing because the expansion of industrial fields requiring high precision and high specifications of embedded systems and the increase in the complexity of embedded software. This paper proposes efficient ways to detect and defend against malfunctions in the run-time system by automatically generating codes to compare with the malfunction patterns of a target system using normal current/voltage patterns. The proposed monitoring system is controlled using (1) a recovery algorithm that initializes the malfunctioning system and (2) a shutdown algorithm that stops the system for continuous malfunctions.

<h2>LiDAR Sensor</h2>

  Light detection and ranging sensors help autonomous vehicles detect the surrounding environment and the exact distance to an object's position.
  Conventional LiDAR sensors require a certain amount of a power because they detect objects by transmitting lasers at a regular interval according to a resolution.<br />

  Constant power consumption from running multiple LiDAR sensors is detrimental to autonomous and electric vehicles using battery power.
  In this paper, we propose an algorithm that improves the inefficient power consumption during the constant operation of conventional LiDAR sensors.
  LiDAR sensors with the applied algorithm efficiently reduce power consumption in two ways:
  (a) controlling the resolution to vary the laser transmission period of a laser diode depending on the vehicle's speed and (b) reducing the static power consumption using the sleep mode, depending on the surrounding environment.<br />
  <p><img src=images/Algorithm.png style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width:500px"></p><br />
  The proposed LiDAR sensor with the resolution control algorithm reduces the power consumption of the laser diode by 6.92% to 32.43% depending on the vehicle's speed, compared to the maximum number of laser transmissions.<br />

  <p><img src=images/Algorithm2.png style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width:500px"></p><br />
  The sleep mode with a surrounding environment-sensing algorithm reduces power consumption by 60.97%.
  The proposed LiDAR sensor has a risk factor for 4-cycles that does not detect an object in sleep mode, but we are considered to be negligible because it immediately switches to active mode when a change in surrounding conditions occurs.
  The proposed LiDAR sensor was tested on a commercial processor chip with the algorithm controlling the resolution according to the speed and surrounding environment of the vehicle.
  In addition, an integrated processor that reduces the power consumption using an adaptive power mode controller with on-chip code was designed using the Global Foundries 55-nm CMOS process.<br />
